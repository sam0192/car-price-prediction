# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **price of cars** based on various vehicle features.
Regression-based machine learning models are used to learn the relationship between car attributes and their market price.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Car pricing depends on factors such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.
The objective of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts **car prices** using these features.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains structured information about cars and their prices.

### Input Features
- Car name / brand
- Year
- Present price
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type
- Seller type
- Transmission
- Owner type

### Target Variable
- `Selling_Price` – Price of the car
